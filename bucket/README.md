# Overview

This Docker container makes it easy to get an instance of Bitbucket up and running
for evaluative purposes. Atlassian is not yet able to provide support for using Docker in production.

# Quick Start

For the `BITBUCKET_HOME` directory that is used to store the repository data
(amongst other things) we recommend mounting a host directory as a [data volume](https://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockervolumes/#mount-a-host-directory-as-a-data-volume):

Set permissions for the data directory so that the runuser can write to it:

    $> docker run -u root -v /data/bitbucket:/var/atlassian/application-data/bitbucket atlassian/bitbucket-server chown -R daemon  /var/atlassian/application-data/bitbucket

Start Atlassian Bitbucket Server:

    $> docker run -v /data/bitbucket:/var/atlassian/application-data/bitbucket --name="bitbucket" -d -p 7990:7990 -p 7999:7999 atlassian/bitbucket-server

**Success**. Bitbucket is now available on [http://localhost:7990](http://localhost:7990)*

Please ensure your container has the necessary resources allocated to it.
We recommend 2GiB of memory allocated to accommodate both the application server
and the git processes.
See [Supported Platforms](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BitbucketServer/Supported+platforms) for further information.
    

_* Note: If you are using `docker-machine` on Mac OS X, please use `open http://$(docker-machine ip default):7990` instead._

# Upgrade

To upgrade to a more recent version of Bitbucket Server you can simply stop the `bitbucket`
container and start a new one based on a more recent image:

    $> docker stop bitbucket
    $> docker rm bitbucket
    $> docker run ... (See above)

As your data is stored in the data volume directory on the host it will still
be available after the upgrade.

_Note: Please make sure that you **don't** accidentally remove the `bitbucket`
container and its volumes using the `-v` option._

# Backup

For evalutations you can use the built-in database that will store its files in the Bitbucket Server home directory. In that case it is sufficient to create a backup archive of the directory on the host that is used as a volume (`/data/bitbucket` in the example above).

The [Bitbucket Server Backup Client](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BitbucketServer/Data+recovery+and+backups) is currently not supported in the Docker setup. You can however use the [Bitbucket Server DIY Backup](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET+SERVER/Using+Bitbucket+DIY+Backup) approach in case you decided to use an external database.

# Versioning

The `latest` tag matches the most recent release of Atlassian Bitbucket Server.
Thus `atlassian/bitbucket:latest` will use the newest version of Bitbucket Server available.

Alternatively you can use a specific minor version of Bitbucket Server by using a version number
tag: `atlassian/bitbucket-server:4.0`. This will install the latest `4.0.x` version that
is available.
